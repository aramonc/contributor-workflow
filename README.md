## Ready to start contributing?

### 1. Go to: http://github.com/Code-For-Miami, find the project you are interested in and fork it, then clone your forked repository into the desired directory on your machine.
    cd path/to/desired/directory-name
    git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/NAME-OF-THE-FORKED-REPO.git

### 2. To keep your fork up to date you’ll need to create an upstream remote from the Code for Miami project repository:
    cd <directory-name>
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/Code-For-Miami/NAME-OF-REPO-YOU-FORKED.git
    git fetch upstream

### 3. Create a new branch from our dev branch.

We won’t consider any pull requests for commits that are made directly in any of these branches: master or gh-pages.


### Working in the dev branch

### 1. Always make sure you’re on dev branch. You’ll see an asterix by the branch that is checked out.
    git branch

If your branch is not checked out:
    git checkout dev

### 2. Updating your fork from the Code for Miami repo
    git pull upstream package
__NOTE:__ If you have any conflicts, you will need to fix the affected file manually and `git add file-name`

### 3. Change files. Then add and commit.
    git commit -am “My commit message”

### 4. Push changes.
    git push

### 5. Issue a pull request.
